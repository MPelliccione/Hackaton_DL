Matteo Pelliccione, Alessandro Massari

After several attemps and very different kind of models from VGAE until the last GIN network we weren't able to reach the baseline fixed for the Hackaton.
For sure our approach was completely wrong from a 'just copy and win' point of view, 
cause instead of use CTRL+C and CTRL+V we started exploring all the possible
models, losses, optimizator and so on and so forth. 
We learnt a lot but don't get the point, that's life: you cannot win and learn a the same time!
Now we are little angry cause we spent six days of our lifes just coding as foolish is sunny days,
but maybe we just need to rest.
